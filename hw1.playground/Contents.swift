//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: They are not the same type. The values passed into the init function are of type optionals. The instance variables are of type implicitly unwrapped optional Strings. Using an implicitly unwrapped optional is different from an optional because you don't have to unwrap it every time it's used.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: "Let" won't let the variable i be mutated, and in this function it's being incremented, so that's why the compiler didn't like it. The variable numElements doesn't change, so it should be a constant instead. Also, the function does not return a Bool at the end if it goes through the entire for loop. The function is also a class function meaning you do not need an instance of Words in order to use the function.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()  //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The problem with declaring **countLetters** was that it was not initialized with the proper syntax. Also, what's wrong with this function is that you need an instance of Words in order to use their instance members, so I removed the class function.
